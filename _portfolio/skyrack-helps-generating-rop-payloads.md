Skyrack disassembles binaries for most platforms on any CPU-reachable offset, stores their assembly in a SQlite database, and enables the user to search for it. A tiny DSL enables to write configurations files that Skyrack can compile in actual payloads, to be injected for instance during a buffer overflow exploitation.
