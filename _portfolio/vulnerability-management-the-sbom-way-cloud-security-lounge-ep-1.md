Hosts Jean-Baptiste Aviat and Izar Tarandach kick off the series with Steve Springett (ServiceNow Director of Product Security and OWASP CycloneDX lead) . They discuss Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) – common use cases, vendor pushback, and why SBOMs alone aren't a silver bullet – as well as how SBOM formats will evolve to improve vulnerability management .
