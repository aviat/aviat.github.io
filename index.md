# About me

I'm building security products. I was CTO and
co-founder at Sqreen which got acquired by
Datadog in 2021. I'm now building security
capabilities in the Datadog product.

Previously I hunt security bugs at Apple and as a
pentester, helping developers and companies solve
them, and developing protection used by millions
of devices.
